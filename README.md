## UACED Electron App

The UACED Electron App was developed in the Spring of 2021.  It's purpose is to run backend scripts in order to collect and scrape the [Alaska Year-to-Year Job Numbers](https://live.laborstats.alaska.gov/ces/ces.cfm?at=01&a=000000&adj=0).


This App can be installed on Windows, Macs and Linux machines.

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

[Package and distribute the application](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start#package-and-distribute-the-application)
